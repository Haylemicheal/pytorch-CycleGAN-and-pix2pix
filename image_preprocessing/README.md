Sketch-to-image synthesis using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN)

# Usage

python3 sketch.py --input INPUT_FOLDER_PATH --output [OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH] [--train TRAIN_FOLDER_PATH]

# TODO

- Making it work for images of 2-D numerical array

- Take specific inputs in addition to a folder
